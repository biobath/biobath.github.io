# Welcome

I have a bunch of very specific thoughts that I think people on the internet could find useful or entertaining. Inspired by people like [tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily), [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) and [Prime](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen), I wanted to create some content. Some of my [friends](/about) have shown an interest on this too, so I deployed BioBath to make it easy for them.

Posts authors are distinguished by their accent color (progress bar on top of this page). To give you an idea of what _my_ posts might look like, here's a random note with ideas of mine (one of _ackshually_ thousands):

- CDNs, DNS, proxies, reverse proxies, etc., explained with simple examples and implementations.
- Explore song visualizations. Make each pixel x, y, c of the image to w, t, FT(w).
- Dwitter sketches explained.
- Custos do aerom√≥vel.
- Playground, a tool to quickly get a code snippet up and running.
- Easy to type, secure passwords.
- Anki bot
- PDF reflow for small screens.
- Events app with presets to timet track everything.
- Read and follow some "hands on" network administration book or guide using VMs or Docker containers.
- Blog post about redefining the meaning of "perfect" to avoid compulsive behavior.
- Do https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ and think of p5js sketches I could do with it.
- Metre analyzer in p5
- Unimpressive facts: a Twitter bot that takes impressive facts and replace one word with it's antonym.
- Follow https://wyag.thb.lt/
- Tree todo list
- Live location recorder
- System wide Journal-like application

Hope ya'll like it. :)
